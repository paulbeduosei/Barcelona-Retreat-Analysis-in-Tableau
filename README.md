# Barcelona-Retreat-Analysis-in-Tableau

The analysis is centered on the relationship between property value and neighborhood safety across Barcelona's districts.

1. Neighborhood Safety Profile (Crime Rate Analysis)

Geographic Risk Mapping: Visual mapping of Crime Index or Rate by District (e.g., theft, public disturbance, etc.) to quickly identify the highest and lowest safety areas.

Safety Hotspots vs. Coldspots: Identification of specific barrios (neighborhoods) within districts that act as outliers (e.g., a quiet pocket in an otherwise high-crime district, or vice versa).

Trend Analysis: Visualization of how crime rates have evolved over time (e.g., quarterly or annually), allowing stakeholders to assess if safety is improving or deteriorating in key investment zones.

2. Pricing and Value Assessment

Price Disparity: Comparison of the Average Daily Rate (ADR) or Median Listing Price for comparable properties (e.g., 2-bedroom apartments) across all neighborhoods. This shows which areas command a price premium.

Price Volatility: Analysis of price standard deviation to identify neighborhoods with stable pricing (low risk) versus those with highly fluctuating pricing (high market risk).

3. Strategic Price-Safety Correlation (The Core Insight)

The Safety Premium: A scatter plot or quadrant analysis that directly maps Rental Price vs. Crime Rate. This is the most powerful insight:

High Value Zones: High Price / Low Crime Rate (Premium market, high-demand areas like parts of Eixample).

Undervalued Gems: Low/Mid Price / Low Crime Rate (Ideal for new investment, potential for future price growth).

Risk Traps: High Price / High Crime Rate (Overpriced areas where price does not reflect security; potential bubble).

Budget Zones: Low Price / High Crime Rate (Targeted primarily at budget-conscious travelers).

Price Adjustment Strategy: Provides the data needed to justify a price reduction in a high-crime area (to meet market reality) or a price increase in a low-crime area (where safety is undervalued).

Targeted Marketing: Helps managers tailor their marketing copy: focusing on "safety and peace of mind" for properties in low-crime areas, and focusing on "centrality and accessibility" for properties in high-crime areas.
